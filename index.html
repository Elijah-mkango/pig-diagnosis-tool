<h2>CORE ADVICE FOR PIG FARMERS</h2><br><br>
<i><b>BEFORE YOU BEGIN USING THIS TOOL CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:</b></I><br><br>
<b>1. Biosecurity & Disease Prevention</b><br>  
<li>Limit visitors and control movement of people, vehicles, and equipment into pig areas.

<li>Quarantine new pigs before mixing them with the herd.

<li>Regularly disinfect pens, feeding equipment, and water troughs.

<li>Vaccinate against common diseases (PRRS, Mycoplasma, Erysipelas, Parvovirus, etc.) as recommended by a vet.

<li>Watch for early signs of illness (fever, coughing, diarrhea, poor growth) and act quickly.<br><br>

<b>2. Nutrition & Feeding</b><br>
<li>Provide a balanced diet with adequate protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals.

<li>Ensure piglets receive iron supplementation to prevent anemia.

<li>Avoid moldy feed to prevent mycotoxicosis.

<li>Always provide clean, fresh water — dehydration worsens most diseases.<br><br>

<b>3. Housing & Environment</b><br>
<li>Keep pens clean, dry, and well-ventilated to reduce respiratory diseases.

<li>Avoid overcrowding — stress increases disease risk and reduces growth.

<li>Maintain comfortable temperatures, especially for piglets (they chill easily).<br><br>

<b>4. Breeding & Reproduction</b><br>
<li>Monitor sows for fertility, pregnancy, and farrowing health.

<li>Prevent reproductive diseases (PPV, Leptospirosis, Brucellosis) through vaccination and hygiene.

<li>Provide good nutrition during gestation and lactation for strong piglets.<br><br>

<b>5. Parasite Control</b><br>
<li>Deworm regularly (internal parasites like roundworms, whipworms, lungworms).

<li>Treat external parasites (mange, lice, ticks) with ivermectin or approved acaricides.

<li>Keep bedding clean and control rodents (they spread disease).<br><br>

<b>6. Record Keeping & Management</b><br>
<li>Keep records of births, deaths, treatments, vaccinations, and feed usage.

<li>Track growth rates and adjust feeding programs accordingly.

<li>Use records to identify recurring problems and improve herd performance.<br><br>

<b>7. Market & Business Side</b><br>
<li>Stay updated on local pig prices and market demand.

<li>Build relationships with reliable buyers, abattoirs, or cooperatives.

<li>Explore value addition (e.g., pork processing, pig manure for fertilizer).
